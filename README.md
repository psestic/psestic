## About Me

I hold a Master's degree in Logic from the University of Amsterdam, where my studies delved into the intricate relationship between logic and computation. My academic focus has been on the intersection of these two fields, exploring the ways in which logic can be applied to computer science and vice versa.

I am currently expanding my skill set in my new role as a DevOps Engineer.
