# Patrik Sestic
Computer Science | Software Engineering | MSc Logic & Computation


## About Me

I hold a Master's degree in Logic from the University of Amsterdam, where my studies delved into the intricate relationship between logic and computation. My academic focus has been on the intersection of these two fields, exploring the ways in which logic can be applied to computer science and vice versa.

Given this academic foundation, I am naturally interested in exploring job opportunities as a software engineer, where I could apply my logical thinking and problem-solving skills to develop innovative software solutions.

I am currently expanding my skill set by delving into back-end development. Through online courses and practical projects, I am acquiring hands-on experience in building scalable and secure web applications, mastering concepts such as server-side programming, API development, and database management. With each new concept I grasp and every line of code I write, I am growing more confident in my ability to contribute to the ever-evolving field of software engineering.
